### **About Myself**

I am a 3rd year student of BNTU , studying at the Faculty of Information Technology and Robotics. I have recently discovered the field of web development, I would like to connect my life with this direction. There were no disciplines particularly related to this at the university, I'm trying to study on my own and chose frontend for myself, I really like to see the result of my work right away. I would like to learn how to make a high-quality layout to begin with, and in the future it is possible to become a fullstack developer. At the moment there is no one with real experience.From the knowledge there is a database of HTML, CSS and I am getting closer to the beginning of studying JS
